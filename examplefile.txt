time: This module provides various time-related functions, and it is used here to measure the time taken for reading or writing files.
os: This module provides a way of interacting with the operating system, and it is used here to check if a file already exists.

The read_file function takes a file name as an argument.
It attempts to open the file in read mode ('r') using a with statement to ensure proper file handling.
If the file exists, it reads its content, prints it, and calculates and prints the time taken to read the file.
If the file is not found, it catches a FileNotFoundError and prints a corresponding message.

The write_file function takes a file name and content as arguments.
It checks if the file name ends with ".txt" and appends it if not.
It then checks if the file already exists using os.path.exists. If it does, it prints a message and returns without writing.
If the file does not exist, it opens the file in write mode ('w'), writes the content, and prints the time taken to write.

The main function is the entry point of the program.
It displays a welcome message and enters a loop that presents options to the user: read a file, write to a file, or exit.
It takes user input to determine the chosen option and executes the corresponding function (read_file, write_file, or exit the loop).
